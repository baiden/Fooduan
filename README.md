# Fooduan
An Android Basics Nano degree course project from Udacity
### Project Description: 
**Build a Single Screen App.**
Design and implement a single screen app that displays information about a fictional small business. Think along the lines of your favorite coffeeshop, local restaurant, or that gem of a store that sells those rare comic books or records.

**Fooduan** is a food app that allows one to make orders and payment for burgers and hotdogs. This project is in its early state of development.
